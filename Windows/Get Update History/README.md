# Get Update History (Windows)

## Background

This is a PowerShell script that lists all of the Windows updates installed on a machine (including feature updates, hotfixes, etc.) and formats it as a table.

## Usage

The script can be ran by downloading `GetUpdateHistory.ps1`, opening a PowerShell instance **as an admin**, and running the script with `GetUpdateHistory.ps1`. Alternatively, the script can ran right from the command line as a one-liner.

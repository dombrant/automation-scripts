# Get Update History (macOS)

## Background

This is a Bash script that lists all of the updates installed on a Mac including macOS updates, rapid security response updates, and app updates.

## Usage

The script can be ran by downloading `GetUpdateHistory.sh`, running `chmod u+x ./GetUpdateHistory.sh`, and running the script with `./GetUpdateHistory.sh`. Alternatively, the script can ran right from the command line as a one-liner.

Additionally, the script can be easily modified to filter out specific updates. See the commented out examples of searching for Microsoft Teams updates and macOS updates.

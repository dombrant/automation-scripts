# Get macOS Version (including RSR version)

## Background

This is a Bash script that retrieves the device's macOS version number, including the rapid security response version number (if one is installed).

## Usage

The script can be ran by downloading `GetmacOSVersion.sh`, running `chmod u+x ./GetmacOSVersion.sh`, and running the script with `./GetmacOSVersion.sh`. Alternatively, the script can ran right from the command line as a one-liner.

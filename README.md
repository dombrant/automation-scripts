# Automation Scripts

This is a collection of scripts I've found useful for automating tasks on both macOS and Windows. Most of these scripts are written in either Bash or PowerShell, and while they are aimed at being used in Jamf Pro or Microsoft Intune, most are MDM-agnostic. Each script has its own readme file to how to use it.

Please note that some of these scripts are not fully guaranteed to work, and should be tested before being placed into a production environment.
